# Student Registration System

This is a simple Student Registration System implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and MySQL for data storage. This application allows you to add, update, delete, search, and reset student records.

## Features

- Add a new student record by entering the student ID, first name, last name, address, and phone number.
- Update existing student records.
- Delete student records.
- Search for students by student ID, first name, last name, address, or phone number.
- Reset the database by deleting all student records.

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server
- Python MySQL Connector library (`mysql-connector-python`)
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
